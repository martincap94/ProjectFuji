# ProjectFuji

ProjectFuji is a codename of my master's thesis application. The application is a very light game engine / framework with one main purpose, that is the simulation of *orographic clouds*, i.e. clouds that develop in mountainous environments. The simulator is based on SkewT/LogP diagrams and uses the Lattice Boltzmann method for wind simulation. Both methods are parallelized with CUDA technology, which means that CUDA Toolkit (10.0) is needed for it to work. Besides CUDA, OpenGL 4.6 and the [Nuklear library](https://github.com/vurtun/nuklear "Nuklear") are utilized.

For more information about the project, please see my webiste www.martincap.io.
