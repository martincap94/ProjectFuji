# ProjectFuji

ProjectFuji is a codename of my Master's thesis application. The application is a very light game engine with one main purpose, that is the simulation of *orographic clouds*. Orographic clouds are clouds that are created in mountainous environments.

For more information about the project, please see my webiste www.martincap.io.
