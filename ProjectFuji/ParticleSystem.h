*  Defines ParticleSystem class that is used in both 2D and 3D simulations.
*  As you may notice, the class uses glm::vec3 for particle vertices representation which is
*  very inefficient when 2D simulation is used. This stems from the fact that I originally
*  planned to remove 2D simulation in the process but it proved very useful for testing concepts
*  and for visualizing scenes that are difficult to debug in 3D.
